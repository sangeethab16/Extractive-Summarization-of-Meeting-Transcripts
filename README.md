# Extractive-Summarization-of-Meeting-Transcripts

Meetings are a common type of interaction in most of the industries. Also, they tend to get prolonged for hours and often filled with important information. 
Therefore, it is difficult to remember all the important points discussed during the meeting.  automatic summarisation reduces the difficulty of documenting the minutes of meetings. 
In this project we would like to perform extractive summarization on the meeting transcripts derived from audio recordings of the meetings. 
The end product of this project can be used by all the organizations who use meetings as a mode of interaction.
